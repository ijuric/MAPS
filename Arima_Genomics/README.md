# MAPS Pipeline for Arima-HiChIP with Arima-HiC<sup>+</sup> Kit
This pipeline is for analyzing HiChIP data with MAPS and for generating Arima Genomics QC metrics and output data files. The pipeline runs the normal MAPS algorithm from https://github.com/ijuric/MAPS with some minor changes to the default parameters. These parameters have been optimized by internal benchmarking and have been found to optimize sensitivity and specificity. This pipeline will also generate shallow and deep sequencing QC metrics which can be copied into the Arima-HiChIP_QC_Worsheet.xls for analysis. Additionally, the pipeline automatically generates metaplots for data QC and arc plots of chromatin loops for data visualization.

## Getting Started
This pipeline is suited for HiChIP from any protocol but optimal results are obtained when using the Arima-HiC<sup>+</sup> kit with the Arima-HiChIP protocol.

To order Arima-HiC<sup>+</sup> kits, please visit our website:

https://arimagenomics.com/

There are two ways to install the Arima MAPS pipeline: using the pre-built Docker image or installing it manually. We recommend using the Docker image since it is easy to setup and more robust across different platforms.

### Using MAPS from the Arima pre-built Docker image
You can use the Arima pre-built Docker image to run the MAPS pipeline. In order to use this Docker image, please run:

```
docker pull arimaxiang/arima_maps_hichip:0.1
```

Then the downloaded image will appear in your local image list. You can verify this by running:

```
docker image ls
```

To run this image in a container, please run:

```
docker run -it --name MAPS_test arimaxiang/arima_maps_hichip:0.1
```

Alternatively, you can utilize Docker's "volume" option to store data generated by and used by Docker containers. This is a convenient way of exchanging data between the container and the host machine.
To create a volume and check the list of volumes, please run:
```
docker volume create [volume_name]
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect [volume_name]
```

Then you can run Docker using the following command. This will map your "target" folder "/MAPS/test_data/test_output_docker/" in the container to your "source" folder on your host machine. You can use "docker volume inspect [volume_name]" command to find out the source folder.
```
docker run -it --name MAPS_test --mount source=[volume_name],target=/MAPS/test_data/test_output_docker/ arima_maps_hichip:0.1
```

When you finish running the container, you can delete it by running:

```
docker stop [container_ID]
docker rm [container_ID]
```

To find the [container_ID], please run:

```
docker container ls
```

You can remove the volume using:

```
docker volume rm [volume_name]
```

### Installing MAPS manually
Alternatively, you can install MAPS yourself. Please refer to the documentation at: https://github.com/ijuric/MAPS for help installing MAPS and its dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/ijuric/MAPS.git
```

Please move Arima-MAPS_v2.0.sh from MAPS/Arima_Genomics/ directory to "MAPS/bin/" directory after downloading.
